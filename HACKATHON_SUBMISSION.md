## 🎯 KEY INNOVATION: URGENCY PAYMENT MODE

### Problem Solved:
Users often need to pay urgently (e.g., emergency medical expense, quick purchase) but don't have time to categorize the payment. This leads to:
- Forgotten transactions
- Inaccurate budgeting
- Financial stress during emergencies

### Solution: Two-Step Payment Process
**Normal Mode:**
1. Select bundle → Pay → Budget updates immediately

**Urgent Mode (⚡ Skip & Pay Now):**
1. Pay now without selecting bundle
2. Payment recorded as "UNCATEGORIZED"
3. Categorize later at leisure
4. Budget updates when categorized

### Result:
✅ Users can handle emergencies confidently  
✅ Financial discipline maintained  
✅ Flexible categorization when calm  
✅ No data loss or inaccuracy
